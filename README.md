## 📌 Task
**Task 1 - Prodigy Internship**  
Train a language model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt using GPT-2.

## 🧠 Model
The model used is [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI.

I fine-tuned GPT-2 on a custom text dataset that includes motivational, poetic, and AI-related content. After training, the model is able to generate new paragraphs that follow the style of the training data.
